# GSE-GENERATION-MATLAB
CHOUAKRI_App_GSE_PACKET UI -User Interface- interactively genrate GSE -Generic Stream Encapsulation- packets destinated for  DVB-S2 IP Transmission developed by CHOUAKRI Sid Ahmed based on the refernced document ETSI TS 102 606: "Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE)   Protocol".   
 The UI consists of 3 drop-downs, that would be executed in series, that are: the primary one "PADDING, PDU, RESET", "NO-FRAGM (that means full PDU packet), FRGMNT (to generate the GSE packets of a fragmented PDU packet)" and "MAC 6 BYTES, MAC 3 BYTES" (to choose either 6- or 3-byte NPA Address). Additionally, the UI comprises a set of text editor fields to enter the required data of each specific generated GSE packet type, that are: the number of padding 0 byte, the fragment identifier, the fragmentation lengths excluding the last legth (that would be deduced by the algorithm), that are expressed in decimal notation, the EtherType compatible Type Fields between 0x600 (1536 decimal) and 0xFFFF, either 6- or 3-byte NPA Address, and the original PDU Packet, that are expressed in hexadecimal notation. On the other hands, additional set of text editor fields permits displaying the full GSE packet as well as a set of the fragmented GSE packets of a PDU packet, and their packetsâ€™ lengths and total length.  
  It calls 2 fundamental Matlab-coded functions,that are :
  CHOUAKRI_KERNEL_GSE_PCKT.m and  CHOUAKRI_FRAGMT_GSE.m
